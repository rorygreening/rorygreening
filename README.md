## Hello there, I'm Rory. 👋

I am a Game Design Student currently studying at the University of Toronto through their Game Design Bootcamp program. 🏫

I am originally a history student by education, a former business analyst by trade, and I am now working hard to develop myself into a narrative designer in the medium of video games. ✍

I work primarily within Unreal Engine 5 and currently have several prototypes in the works that I cannot wait to share! 🎮

My goal is to design games that provide innovative narrative experiences and combine well-developed worlds, memorable characters, and compelling stories in settings in both historical and fantastic! 📖
